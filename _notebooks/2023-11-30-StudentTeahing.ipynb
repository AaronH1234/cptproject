    "- Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- One way to accomplish network redunadancy is by having more than one path between any to connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route if it's possible to reach that.\n",

    "- Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance.\n",

    "- The redundancy of routing options between 2 points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to the more devices and more people.\n"
