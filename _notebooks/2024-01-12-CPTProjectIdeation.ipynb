    "We all share a common issue in San Diego, and that is trying to find authentic Chinese food. Other websites such as yelp or google do not always help, as some of the reviews are innacurate. That is why in our website, we will have a chinese food informational website based in San Diego and nearby. When you open up our website you will see three main sections:"

We will complete this by using POST requests specifically for user login, signup, and submitting reviews. The POST request will send form data to our server, effectively allowing user side actions to be saved on the website. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is where user login is important. Users will be able to leave reviews under restaurants they've been to. This will be helpful, as it will help others discover good Chinese food and they will know what to order when they go there. Again, POST requests will be used to allow users to submit reviews, and GET requests will be used to fetch the list of reviews. For an additional challenge, we can use PUT requests to allow users to edit their reviews."
